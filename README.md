### Innocosm project
Innocosm.org is a 501(c)3 Foundation for Educational and Technology fields. 

Donations are used to defray the costs of domain renewal, and hosting in the cloud. There are no paid positions at the Foundation. All work is done by volunteers
##### Note: We are not accepting donations at this time while waiting on IRS approval and tax ID number required to do so.

#### Project time line target is the Spring 2022 for the Alpha release, followed later by a limited public Beta release before available to anyone.

### Our Mission:
Create a tool based on a proven, knowlege based innovative methodology that can be used by individuals to seek innovative solutions to challenges in their lives.

### Our goals:
Create an Open Source Web Application that will embody the proven knowledge based innovative methods in a format that anyone can use without formal training required to become a practitioner of these methods that is the greatest barrier to widespread adoption. 

### Our gratitude goes out to those that made all this possible:
