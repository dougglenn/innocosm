#### The project is based on Django and we are seeking interested open source python developers familiar with Django. We will also be looking for additional people with some skills like the application UI, writing documentation, javascript, CSS and HTML as the project matures to the point these skills are needed. I want to thank all of you for your curiosity and perhaps gain the desire to become part of the Innocosm community.

### Innocosm project
Innocosm is a web application for Educational and Technology fields using Django 

### Our Mission:
Create an open source application based on a proven, knowlege based innovative methodology with open source and commercial releases.

### Our goals:
Build the application in a format that anyone can use without formal training required to become a practitioner of these methods that is the greatest barrier to widespread adoption. 

### Our gratitude goes out to those that made all this possible:
